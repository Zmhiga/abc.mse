Description: The purpose of this R package is to illustrate Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a simulation-based inference method used to obtain the 
posterior distribution of parameters given the data. In this R package, we approximate a joint likelihood of the data by simulating the prior probability 
for the parameter(s) of interest, generate a data set under the parameter(s), and then compare a summary statistic of this data set to the summary statistic 
of the observed data. We accept the value of the simulated parameter as if it were from the posterior if the difference between the simulated and observed 
summary statistic are within some error (say epsilon). We iterate through this process a number of times, then we take the mean of the accepted values to 
be a point estimate of the parameter(s).    For each simulation of the data generating functions, we generate one point
estimate of the parameter(s), and so the number of point estimates of the parameter(s) that we obtain is the same as the number of simulations we ran.
Taking the mean of these posterior point estimates gives us an ABC estimator, and we calculate the variance of the ABC estimator as well. Then we can 
calculate the mean-square error to assess the approximation of the estimator. In this program, we find the ABC estimators of exponential distributions, 
Cauchy distributions (heavier-tailed distribution), and Gumbel distributions (lighter-tailed distribution).
