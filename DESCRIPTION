Description: The purpose of this R package is to illustrate Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a simulation-based inference method used to obtain the posterior distribution of parameters given the data. In this program, we find the ABC estimators (the mean of the posterior) of exponential distributions, Cauchy distributions (heavier-tailed distribution), and Gumbel distributions (lighter-tailed distribution).
